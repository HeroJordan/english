  11) Veronica, if I may suggest apply only for 3 to 5 jobs every month. This way you can: 
	- 1) really focus on the ones that interest you and that are a good fit; 
	- 2) do your do research for each of them in order to know the company better; 
	- 3) taylor your CV and your cover letter to match each job that you are applying for.

	This way you can still get 2 or 3 interviews each month and you will be much more prepared.
	
  12) I have to say I'm good at it - I always manage to make a good impression. 
		It doesn't mean I got all the jobs I applied for, but I never had a bad experience. 
		Here are my tips: 
		- Dress up to look presentable (like one of the famous fashion observers once said: "If you want to be promoted to a higher position, start dressing like a boss"). 
		- Arrive 10-15 minutes earlier to have time to find the right door, take a deep breath and tune in. 
		- Remember that you have skills and experience that can be valuable for the employer, be confident. 
		- Demonstrate genuine interest and enthusiasm about the job and the company. 
		- Be involved - listen carefully and ask questions. Turn your job interview into job conversation. 
		All that and a bit of good luck and you are golden :))
